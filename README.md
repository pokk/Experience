# Introduction
---

This is for learning classic algorithm note. You can find classic problems everyone's known. Also, we provided
some solutions for each problems. After we studied, this note is not only for me to reminder myself, also we
wanna share them to everyone.

# Categories of algorithm
---

Now we're building __DP(Dynamic Programming)__ now. Inside of DP, we added the __backtracking__ algorithm for
tacking the answer we found.

* Dynamic programming
* Graph
* Mathematic
* Brute-force
* Recursion

We will add them continuously.
