# Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Problem

Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it. For example, if the given sequence is 

<font color="gray">
  <strong>'BBABCBCAB'</strong>
</font>

, then the output should be 7 as 

<font color="gray">
  <strong>'BABCBAB'</strong>
</font>

 is the longest palindromic subsequence in it. 

<font color="gray">
  <strong>'BBBBB'</strong>
</font>

 and "BBCBB" are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.

## Algorithm

This problem we could solve by dynamic programming. Given a sequence: string[0...n-1], the length of sequence is n.
